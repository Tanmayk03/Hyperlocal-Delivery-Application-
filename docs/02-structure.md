# Project Structure

Hyper Delivery Application is organized into two main folders: `client/` for the frontend and `server/` for the backend. Here's a complete breakdown:

## 📁 Client Folder Structure
```plaintext
client/
├── public/
│   ├── index.html
│   └── favicon.ico
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── pages/
│   ├── App.js
│   └── index.js
├── package.json
└── .env
```
### Explanation
- **public/**: Contains static files like `index.html` and `favicon.ico`.
- **src/**: Contains the main application code.
  - **components/**: Reusable UI components.
  - **pages/**: Page components for routing.
  - **App.js**: Main application component.
  - **index.js**: Entry point for React.
- **package.json**: Project metadata and dependencies.
- **.env**: Environment variables.
## 📁 Server Folder Structure
```plaintext
server/
├── config/
│   ├── db.js
│   └── config.js
├── controllers/
│   ├── userController.js

- **server.js**: Entry point for the backend server.
- **package.json**: Project metadata and dependencies.
## 🗂️ Additional Notes

- Ensure that both `client/` and `server/` have their own `package.json` files for managing dependencies.
- Use environment variables to manage sensitive information like database URIs and API keys.
- The project follows a modular structure, making it easy to maintain and scale.
- The frontend and backend can be run independently, allowing for easier development and testing.
- The project is designed to be easily deployable, with clear separation between client and server code.
- The structure supports both development and production environments, with configurations for each.    
- The use of Mongoose ODM in the backend simplifies database interactions and schema management.
- The project is built with scalability in mind, allowing for future enhancements like additional features or integrations.
